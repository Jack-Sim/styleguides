Python Coding Standards
=======================

As a general rule, Python project code should follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). This has been made into a nicer, more [readable version](https://pep8.org/).

You can easily use the [Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) python package to enforce a minimum of PEP8 styling to files at any point, usage instructions found on it's package description.
