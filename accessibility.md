# Accessibility Standards

## Background

New regulations came into force for public sector bodies on 23 September 2018.

They say you must make your website or mobile app more accessible by making it ‘perceivable, operable, understandable and robust’.

You can do this by meeting the accessibility standards.

Your website or app will meet the new public sector requirement to be more accessible if it complies with the international WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standard.
